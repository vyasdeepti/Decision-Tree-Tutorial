## Introduction

Decision Trees are one of the most intuitive and widely used algorithms in machine learning and statistics for both classification and regression tasks. This tutorial provides a deep dive into their concepts, construction, mathematics, and implementation.


## What is a Decision Tree?

A **Decision Tree** is a flowchart-like structure, where:

- Each internal node represents a feature (attribute),
- Each branch represents a decision rule,
- Each leaf node represents an outcome (class label or value).

Decision Trees can be used for:
- **Classification** (categorical outcomes)
- **Regression** (continuous outcomes)



## Types of Decision Trees

- **Classification Trees**: Output is a class label. Example: Yes/No, Spam/Not Spam.
- **Regression Trees**: Output is a continuous value. Example: Predicting house prices.



## How Does a Decision Tree Work?

The algorithm splits the dataset into subsets based on the value of input features. This process is recursive and continues until all (or most) data points in a subset belong to the same class (or have similar values for regression).



## Decision Tree Terminology

- **Root Node**: The top node, represents the entire dataset.
- **Decision Node**: A node that splits into further nodes.
- **Leaf/Terminal Node**: A node with no further splits; gives the output.
- **Branch/Subtree**: A section of the tree.
- **Splitting**: The process of dividing a node into two or more sub-nodes.
- **Pruning**: Removing sub-nodes to reduce overfitting.

## Building a Decision Tree: Step-by-Step

### Step 1: Selecting the Best Attribute (Splitting Criterion)

At each node, the algorithm selects the feature that best splits the data. The most common criteria are:

- **Information Gain (ID3/C4.5):** Used for classification.
- **Gini Impurity (CART):** Used for classification.
- **Variance Reduction:** Used for regression.

In decision trees, **entropy** and **information gain** are fundamental concepts used to determine the best way to split the data at each node. They aim to create a tree that effectively classifies or predicts the target variable by reducing uncertainty.

**Entropy in Decision Trees**

Entropy, in the context of decision trees, measures the impurity or randomness of a subset of data. A high entropy value indicates that the subset contains a mix of different classes, making it less predictable. Conversely, a low entropy value signifies that the subset is more homogeneous, with instances primarily belonging to a single class.

Mathematically, for a dataset $S$ with $n$ classes, the entropy $H(S)$ is calculated as:

$$H(S) = - \sum_{i=1}^{n} p_i \log_2(p_i)$$

Where:
- $p_i$ is the proportion of instances in $S$ that belong to class $i$.
- The logarithm is base 2, so entropy is measured in bits.

**Intuition of Entropy:**

[Information Source]![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ecfe52b2-138f-45e4-927a-ce11d258a15a)


* **Maximum Entropy (High Impurity):** When the classes in a subset are equally distributed, the entropy is at its maximum (e.g., a 50/50 split in a binary classification problem yields an entropy of 1 bit). This signifies the highest level of uncertainty.
* **Minimum Entropy (High Purity):** When a subset contains only one class (it's pure), the entropy is zero. There is no uncertainty in predicting the class of an instance in this subset.
* **Goal of Splitting:** Decision tree algorithms strive to reduce entropy at each split, aiming to create child nodes that are purer than the parent node.

**Information Gain in Decision Trees**

Information gain (IG) quantifies the reduction in entropy achieved after splitting a dataset $S$ on a particular attribute $A$. It essentially measures how much "information" about the target variable is gained by knowing the value of the attribute $A$. The attribute with the highest information gain is preferred for splitting because it leads to the most significant decrease in uncertainty.

The formula for information gain $IG(S, A)$ is:

$$IG(S, A) = H(S) - \sum_{v \in Values(A)} \frac{|S_v|}{|S|} H(S_v)$$

Where:
- $H(S)$ is the entropy of the original dataset $S$.
- $A$ is the attribute being considered for the split.
- $Values(A)$ is the set of all possible values for attribute $A$.
- $S_v$ is the subset of $S$ where attribute $A$ has the value $v$.
- $|S_v|$ is the number of instances in $S_v$.
- $|S|$ is the total number of instances in $S$.
- $H(S_v)$ is the entropy of the subset $S_v$.

**How Information Gain Guides Splitting:**

1.  **Calculate Initial Entropy:** The entropy of the target variable in the current dataset is calculated.
2.  **Calculate Entropy for Each Attribute's Splits:** For each attribute, the dataset is hypothetically split based on its distinct values. The entropy of the target variable for each resulting subset is then calculated.
3.  **Calculate Weighted Average Entropy:** The entropy of each subset is weighted by the proportion of instances it contains relative to the original dataset. These weighted entropies are summed to get the expected entropy after splitting on that attribute.
4.  **Determine Information Gain:** The information gain for an attribute is the difference between the initial entropy and the weighted average entropy after the split.
5.  **Select Best Splitting Attribute:** The attribute with the highest information gain is chosen as the splitting criterion for the current node. This process is recursively repeated for each child node until a stopping condition is met (e.g., a node becomes pure or a maximum tree depth is reached).

In summary, entropy measures the impurity of a node, and information gain helps the decision tree algorithm decide which attribute to use for splitting at each step to maximize the reduction in impurity and effectively classify the data.

### Step 2: Splitting

Divide the dataset into subsets based on the selected attribute's values.

### Step 3: Stopping Criteria

The recursion stops when one or more conditions are met:
- All records belong to the same class.
- There are no remaining attributes.
- The subset is too small (controlled by parameters like `min_samples_split`).

### Step 4: Pruning

After the tree is built, pruning reduces its size by removing nodes that do not provide power in classifying instances to avoid overfitting.

# Detailed Example of a Decision Tree (with Calculations)

Let's consider a simple dataset to predict whether a person will buy a computer (`Yes` or `No`) based on their age and income.

---
üî∂üî∂ **EXAMPLE 1** üî∂üî∂
## Dataset

| Person | Age      | Income  | Buys Computer |
|--------|----------|---------|--------------|
| 1      | <=30     | High    | No           |
| 2      | <=30     | High    | No           |
| 3      | 31...40  | High    | Yes          |
| 4      | >40      | Medium  | Yes          |
| 5      | >40      | Low     | Yes          |
| 6      | >40      | Low     | No           |
| 7      | 31...40  | Low     | Yes          |
| 8      | <=30     | Medium  | No           |
| 9      | <=30     | Low     | Yes          |
| 10     | >40      | Medium  | Yes          |
| 11     | <=30     | Medium  | Yes          |
| 12     | 31...40  | Medium  | Yes          |
| 13     | 31...40  | High    | Yes          |
| 14     | >40      | Medium  | No           |

Let's use the **ID3 algorithm**, which uses **Information Gain** and **Entropy**.



## Step 1: Calculate the Entropy of the Entire Dataset

Let \( S \) be the set of all examples (14 in total).

Number of "Yes": 9  
Number of "No": 5  

$$\[
P(\text{Yes}) = \frac{9}{14}, \quad P(\text{No}) = \frac{5}{14}
\]$$

$$\[
\text{Entropy}(S) = -P(\text{Yes}) \log_2 P(\text{Yes}) - P(\text{No}) \log_2 P(\text{No})
\]$$

$$\[
\text{Entropy}(S) = -\frac{9}{14} \log_2 \frac{9}{14} - \frac{5}{14} \log_2 \frac{5}{14}
\]$$

$$\[
\frac{9}{14} \approx 0.643, \quad \frac{5}{14} \approx 0.357
\]$$

$$\[
\text{Entropy}(S) = -0.643 \log_2 0.643 - 0.357 \log_2 0.357
\]$$

$$\[
\log_2 0.643 \approx -0.64, \quad \log_2 0.357 \approx -1.485
\]$$

$$\[
= -0.643 \times (-0.64) - 0.357 \times (-1.485)
\]
\[
= 0.411 + 0.530 = 0.941
\]$$

**Entropy(S) = 0.941**



## Step 2: Calculate Entropy for Attributes

### A. Attribute: Age

Possible values: <=30, 31...40, >40

#### i. Age = <=30

Subset: Person 1, 2, 8, 9, 11 (5 samples)

"Yes": 2 (Person 9, 11), "No": 3

$$\[
P(\text{Yes}) = \frac{2}{5}, \quad P(\text{No}) = \frac{3}{5}
\]$$
$$\[
\text{Entropy} = -\frac{2}{5}\log_2 \frac{2}{5} - \frac{3}{5}\log_2 \frac{3}{5}
\]$$
$$\[
= -0.4 \log_2 0.4 - 0.6 \log_2 0.6
\]$$
$$\[
\log_2 0.4 \approx -1.322, \quad \log_2 0.6 \approx -0.737
\]$$
$$\[
= -0.4 \times (-1.322) - 0.6 \times (-0.737)
\]$$
$$\[
= 0.529 + 0.442 = 0.971
\]$$

#### ii. Age = 31...40

Subset: Person 3, 7, 12, 13 (4 samples)

All "Yes": 4

$$\[
\text{Entropy} = -1 \log_2 1 - 0 \log_2 0 = 0
\]$$

#### iii. Age = >40

Subset: Person 4, 5, 6, 10, 14 (5 samples)

"Yes": 3 (Person 4, 5, 10), "No": 2 (Person 6, 14)

$$\[
P(\text{Yes}) = \frac{3}{5}, \quad P(\text{No}) = \frac{2}{5}
\]$$
$$\[
\text{Entropy} = -0.6 \log_2 0.6 - 0.4 \log_2 0.4
\]$$
$$\[
= 0.442 + 0.529 = 0.971
\]$$

### Weighted Average Entropy for Age

$$\[
\text{Weighted Entropy} = \frac{5}{14} \times 0.971 + \frac{4}{14} \times 0 + \frac{5}{14} \times 0.971
\]$$
$$\[
= 0.347 + 0 + 0.347 = 0.694
\]$$

### Information Gain for Age

$$\[
\text{Gain}(\text{Age}) = \text{Entropy}(S) - \text{Weighted Entropy}
\]$$
$$\[
= 0.941 - 0.694 = 0.247
\]$$



### B. Attribute: Income

Possible values: High, Medium, Low

#### i. Income = High

Subset: Person 1, 2, 3, 13 (4 samples)

"Yes": 2 (3, 13), "No": 2

$$\[
\text{Entropy} = -0.5 \log_2 0.5 - 0.5 \log_2 0.5 = 1
\]$$

#### ii. Income = Medium

Subset: Person 4, 8, 10, 11, 12, 14 (6 samples)

"Yes": 4 (4, 10, 11, 12), "No": 2 (8, 14)

$$\[
\text{Entropy} = -\frac{4}{6} \log_2 \frac{4}{6} - \frac{2}{6} \log_2 \frac{2}{6}
\]$$
$$\[
\frac{4}{6} = 0.667, \quad \frac{2}{6} = 0.333
\]$$
$$\[
\log_2 0.667 \approx -0.585, \quad \log_2 0.333 \approx -1.585
\]$$
$$\[
= -0.667 \times (-0.585) - 0.333 \times (-1.585)
\]$$
$$\[
= 0.390 + 0.528 = 0.918
\]$$

#### iii. Income = Low

Subset: Person 5, 6, 7, 9 (4 samples)

"Yes": 3 (5, 7, 9), "No": 1 (6)

$$\[
\text{Entropy} = -0.75 \log_2 0.75 - 0.25 \log_2 0.25
\]$$
$$\[
\log_2 0.75 \approx -0.415, \quad \log_2 0.25 = -2
\]$$
$$\[
= -0.75 \times (-0.415) - 0.25 \times (-2)
\]$$
$$\[
= 0.311 + 0.5 = 0.811
\]$$

### Weighted Average Entropy for Income

$$\[
\text{Weighted Entropy} = \frac{4}{14} \times 1 + \frac{6}{14} \times 0.918 + \frac{4}{14} \times 0.811
\]$$
$$\[
= 0.286 + 0.393 + 0.232 = 0.911
\]$$

### Information Gain for Income

$$\[
\text{Gain}(\text{Income}) = 0.941 - 0.911 = 0.03
\]$$



## Step 3: Select Attribute with Highest Info Gain

- Age: 0.247
- Income: 0.03

**Age** is selected as the root node.



## Step 4: Build the Tree

- Split on Age:
  - For Age = 31...40: all samples are "Yes" ‚Üí leaf node ("Yes")
  - For Age = <=30 and >40: need further splitting.

Let's focus on Age = <=30 subset (Person 1, 2, 8, 9, 11):

| Person | Age  | Income  | Buys Computer |
|--------|------|---------|--------------|
| 1      | <=30 | High    | No           |
| 2      | <=30 | High    | No           |
| 8      | <=30 | Medium  | No           |
| 9      | <=30 | Low     | Yes          |
| 11     | <=30 | Medium  | Yes          |

- "Yes": 2, "No": 3

Now, repeat the calculation for this subset using the next attribute (Income).

#### Entropy for Age = <=30

Already calculated above: 0.971

#### a. Split on Income

- High: 1, 2 ("No", "No") ‚Üí Entropy = 0
- Medium: 8, 11 ("No", "Yes") ‚Üí Entropy = 1
- Low: 9 ("Yes") ‚Üí Entropy = 0

Weighted Entropy:

- High: 2/5 √ó 0 = 0
- Medium: 2/5 √ó 1 = 0.4
- Low: 1/5 √ó 0 = 0

Total: 0.4

Information Gain:

$$\[
\text{Gain} = 0.971 - 0.4 = 0.571
\]$$

So, **Income** is the best split for Age = <=30.



## Step 5: Final Decision Tree

**Root Node:** Age

- **Age = 31...40:** Yes
- **Age = <=30:**  
  - **Income = High:** No  
  - **Income = Medium:**  
    - Person 8: No  
    - Person 11: Yes  
  - **Income = Low:** Yes
- **Age = >40:**  
  - Further splits can be made if desired, but based on the example, this is the essential structure.



## Visualization

```
Age?
|-- <=30
|   |-- Income?
|   |   |-- High: No
|   |   |-- Medium: [8: No, 11: Yes]
|   |   |-- Low: Yes
|-- 31...40: Yes
|-- >40
    |-- (Split further based on data)
```



## Summary

- **Root Node:** Attribute with highest info gain (Age).
- **For each branch**, repeat entropy/information gain calculation to decide splits.
- **Leaf nodes** are pure or no further splits are possible.

### Dataset

Consider a simple dataset for predicting whether to play tennis based on weather conditions:

| Outlook | Temperature | Humidity | Windy | PlayTennis |
|---------|-------------|----------|-------|------------|
| Sunny   | Hot         | High     | False | No         |
| Sunny   | Hot         | High     | True  | No         |
| Overcast| Hot         | High     | False | Yes        |
| Rainy   | Mild        | High     | False | Yes        |
| Rainy   | Cool        | Normal   | False | Yes        |
| Rainy   | Cool        | Normal   | True  | No         |
| Overcast| Cool        | Normal   | True  | Yes        |
| Sunny   | Mild        | High     | False | No         |
| Sunny   | Cool        | Normal   | False | Yes        |
| Rainy   | Mild        | Normal   | False | Yes        |
| Sunny   | Mild        | Normal   | True  | Yes        |
| Overcast| Mild        | High     | True  | Yes        |
| Overcast| Hot         | Normal   | False | Yes        |
| Rainy   | Mild        | High     | True  | No         |

```
Outlook?
|-- Sunny
|   |-- Humidity?
|   |   |-- High: No
|   |   |-- Normal: Yes
|-- Overcast: Yes
|-- Rainy
    |-- Windy?
        |-- False: Yes
        |-- True: No
```

### Calculating Entropy and Information Gain

#### Step 1: Calculate Entropy for the Target

**Entropy (S)** is a measure of impurity in a group of examples.

$$\[
Entropy(S) = -p_{+} \log_2(p_{+}) - p_{-} \log_2(p_{-})
\]$$

Where $$\( p_{+} \)$$ is the proportion of positive examples ("Yes") and $$\( p_{-} \)$$ is the proportion of negative examples ("No").

In our dataset:

- "Yes": 9
- "No": 5

$$\[
Entropy(S) = -\frac{9}{14} \log_2\left(\frac{9}{14}\right) - \frac{5}{14} \log_2\left(\frac{5}{14}\right)
\]$$
$$\[
= -0.6429 \times (-0.4730) - 0.3571 \times (-1.4854)
\]$$
$$\[
= 0.940
\]$$

#### Step 2: Calculate Information Gain for "Outlook"

Split by "Outlook":

- **Sunny**: 5 samples (2 Yes, 3 No)
- **Overcast**: 4 samples (4 Yes, 0 No)
- **Rainy**: 5 samples (3 Yes, 2 No)

Entropy for each subset:

- **Sunny**:
  $$\[
  -\frac{2}{5} \log_2\left(\frac{2}{5}\right) - \frac{3}{5} \log_2\left(\frac{3}{5}\right) = 0.971
  \]$$
- **Overcast**:
  $$\[
  -\frac{4}{4} \log_2\left(\frac{4}{4}\right) - 0 = 0
  \]$$
- **Rainy**:
  $$\[
  -\frac{3}{5} \log_2\left(\frac{3}{5}\right) - \frac{2}{5} \log_2\left(\frac{2}{5}\right) = 0.971
  \]$$

Weighted entropy after split on "Outlook":

$$\[
Entropy_{Outlook} = \frac{5}{14} \cdot 0.971 + \frac{4}{14} \cdot 0 + \frac{5}{14} \cdot 0.971 = 0.693
\]$$

**Information Gain**:

$$\[
IG(S, Outlook) = Entropy(S) - Entropy_{Outlook} = 0.940 - 0.693 = 0.247
\]$$

Perform similar calculations for other attributes.

---

## Building the Tree

1. **Root Node**: Choose the attribute with the highest information gain (e.g., "Outlook").
2. **Create branches** for each value of "Outlook".
3. **Repeat** for each branch with the remaining attributes until stopping criteria are met.
